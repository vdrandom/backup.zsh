#### general options ####
## The protocol we want to use to store our backups.
## Can be ftp, sftp, ftps, ssh or local.
protocol='ssh'

## The directory store backups in, locally or remotely.
backup_dir='relative_or_full_path'

## The list of patterns to exclude from backups, for
## more details look into tar -X option.
#exclude_list='/usr/local/etc/backup/excludes.list' 

## The compression algorithm for backups.
## Can be gz, bz2, xz or empty (for non-compressed).
compress_format='xz'

## An array with the set of directories within it.
## Optionally snapshot file can be added to store
## incremental diffs (tar -g option used).
## You'll have to deal with snapshots on your own:
## backup.zsh only handles backups (i.e. you can remove
## snapshot via cron on regular basis to ensure that
## full backups are created from time to time.)
source_dirs=( '/home/user/source1:/var/backup/snapshot.list'
              '/etc' '/var/spool/mail:/var/backup/spool_snapshot.list' )

## Use with caution, the file existance is not checked
## on execution.
## Since this config is sourced, I advise adding some
## logic for that, or you can handle filename collisions
## externally.
#backup_filename='somebackup'

#### remote options ####
## Remote host.
remote_host='hostname.tld'

## Remote user.
remote_user='username'

## Password, due to how openssh handles security it only
## works for *ftp* protocols; backups via ssh protocol
## work interactively. Later versions will have support
## for ssh keys.
remote_pass='PassWd'

## Port is optional, the defaults are hardcoded.
#remote_port='443'

# vim: ft=zsh
